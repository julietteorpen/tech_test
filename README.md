# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Problems solved: 
1. Problem 1 - Players can now play a game of tic tac toe. The winner is delcared, if there is one. If not the game is announced to be a draw.
2. Problem 2 - Players can now play an extra large game of tic tac toe by updating the board size in the drop down.

## Next steps
- With more time, I would complete problem 3 so players are able to see game stats.
- Additionally I would improve the UI as at the moment I have only added some fairly basic styling. 

## Quickstart
- Make sure you have **node** installed
- `cd client`
- `npm i`
- `npm start`


> ## Outline of task
> 
>The below problems are to allow us a glimpse into your problem solving ability, style and current skill set. Please do problem 1, and optionally problem 2 >or 3 depending on where you are most comfortable. We expect this test to take 2-3 hours, if you find yourself spending more than this do not aim to solve >all 3 problems! We will not be judging based on number of problems completed only the style and thought process.

>## Problems
>### Problem 1
>We have started a basic game of Tic-Tac-Toe as outlined [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) but we don't have anyone good enough to code to >finish it! 
>- Please implement a complete basic game of Tic-Tac-Toe
>- Please use React and TypeScript throughout, if you know TailwindCSS please expand on what is already provided, otherwise it is fine to use raw styling 
>- Both players will play out of the same application, it is sufficient to just switch the current player each time a move is played
>- Once a game is completed, I should be able to start another game 


>### Problem 2
>We are bored with the basic game now, can you make it so the board can be scaled to any size? 
>- Add some kind of input which allows me to change the board size
>- The board size should be a number between 3 and 15 

>### Problem 3
>We want to store game results in a database.
>- create a simple backend server (using a simple generator provided by your IDE is fine)
>- use any SQL/noSQL database to store the results
>- return simple stats back to the front-end: number of win/losses for each player.
